# mzipext

A simple CLI tool to extract multiple ZIP files and merge them into a single directory.

## Why mzipext?

When you download large files from the internet, they often come split into multiple ZIP parts (e.g., `Archive-1.zip`, `Archive-2.zip`, ...).  
Manually extracting and merging these parts is tedious:

- Each part usually extracts into its own subfolder
- You end up with duplicated directory structures
- Verifying whether two ZIP files can be merged requires manual inspection

`mzipext` automates this process:

- **One command** to extract multiple ZIPs and merge them into a clean directory
- **Mergeability check** to ensure ZIPs has no conflicting files before extraction
- **Consistent output** so you donâ€™t have to fix folder structures by hand

In short: it saves time, avoids errors, and simplifies working with multi-part ZIP archives.
